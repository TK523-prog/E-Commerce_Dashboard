# NordicStyle Dashboard

This project was completed during the course Business Intelligence with Power BI. 

This report presents a comprehensive performance assessment of NordicStyle for the years 2023 and 2024, based on the integration and analysis of sales, marketing, customer, product, and website traffic data within Power BI. Since its launch in late 2022, NordicStyle has experienced considerable growth, yet lacked a unified view of how its campaigns, channels, customer segments, and products influence business performance. Through the development of a complete star-schema data model and a series of analytical dashboards, this analysis uncovers key insights regarding revenue trends, campaign efficiency, customer behaviour, product profitability, and traffic performance.


## The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
  • Power BI Desktop – Main data visualisation platform used for report creation.

  • Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
  
  • DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
  
  • Data Modelling – Relationships established among tables (resorts, snow, and data_dictionary) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.
  
  • File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.
